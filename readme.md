# Oclis

CLI (Command Line Interface) app builder
based on a simple, obvious specification file.


## Motivation

Building a CLI application is a repetitive task.
The same code is written over and over again.
But fear not, Oclis is here to help you out!


## Usage

1. Install Oclis with
   `cargo install --git https://github.com/Airsequel/Oclis`
1. Create a `oclis.ncl` specifcation file in the root of your project. \
   (Check out the [examples](./examples) directory for inspiration.)
1. Run `oclis build` to generate the CLI parsing code \
   (Automatically detects main repo language,
   but only supports PureScript at the moment.)
1. Define the handler functions for your commands. \
   (Check out the [main function of Transity][tr-main] for an example.)
1. Build and use your project as usual ðŸŽ‰

> [!NOTE]
> The generated code must be committed to the repository.
