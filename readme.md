# Oclis

CLI (Command Line Interface) app builder
based on a simple, obvious specification file.


## Motivation

Building a CLI application is a repetitive task.
The same code is written over and over again.
But fear not, Oclis is here to help you out!


## Usage

1. Write a simple specification file.
2. Run `oclis` to generate the CLI parsing code for the language of your choice.
3. Define the handler functions for your commands.
4. Done ðŸŽ‰
