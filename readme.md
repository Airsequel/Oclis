# Oclis

CLI (Command Line Interface) app builder
based on a simple, obvious specification file.


## Motivation

Building a CLI application is a repetitive task.
The same code is written over and over again.
But fear not, Oclis is here to help you out!


## Usage

1. Install Oclis with
   `cargo install oclis`
1. Create specifcation file skeleton with
   `oclis init`
1. Manually edit the generated `oclis.ncl` file
1. Run `oclis build` to generate the CLI parsing code (automatically detects main repo language)
1. Define the handler functions for your commands.
1. Build and install your project ðŸŽ‰
